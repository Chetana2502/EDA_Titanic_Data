# Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python.  
The goal is to analyze survival patterns with respect to passenger demographics, ticket class, fares, and embarkation points.

## 🔍 Features
- **Data Summary**: `.info()`, `.describe()`, missing values check  
- **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms, boxplots for Age, Fare, etc.  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Survival by Sex, Class, Embarkation  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmap + Pairplot  
- **Visual Storytelling**: Each plot explained with observations  
- **Final Insights**: Key survival factors summarized

## 📊 Key Insights
- Women had significantly higher survival rates than men.  
- First-class passengers had higher survival compared to third class.  
- Higher fares correlated with better survival.  
- Younger passengers (children) were more likely to survive.  
- Passengers from Cherbourg port had better survival chances.
